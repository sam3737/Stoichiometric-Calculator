# Stoichiometric-Calculator

This application solves stoichiometric equations to find unknown quantities in chemical reactions in several formats:

- **Product produced**: known input quantity and unknown output quantity
- **Excess reactant (With Product)**: two known inputs, unknown output quantity and unknown excess reactant
- **Excess reactant (No Product)**: two known inputs and unknown excess reactant
- **Required Reactant (For Product)**: known output quantity and unknown input quantity
- **Required Reactant (For Reactant)**: one known input  quantity and one unknown input quantity (minimum required to fully react)
